When Reminders was released last year I wasn&#8217;t very impressed. I thought it looked like a hastily thrown together front end for location-based reminders intended to be added mainly via Siri. As a 3GS user &#8211; no Siri, no geofencing &#8211; it didn&#8217;t have much to interest me.

Over the course of the year, however, I picked it up now and then and began to appreciate the thought that had gone into many elements of its design. It didn&#8217;t, for example, unnecessarily truncate the task text and required only a tap in an empty space to add a new task. Gradually, I began to use it for short lists.

It wasn&#8217;t until Mountain Lion introduced a Mac version with iCloud syncing that I began to use it more seriously. Due to a few shortcomings, though, the iOS version was something of a pain to use. The new iOS 6 incarnation makes some changes:

**Task Sorting**
  
Perhaps the most baffling design decision of the original iOS Reminders app was the lack of any way to sort tasks. They were displayed in the order they had been added, with no option to sort them manually, alphabetically, or by priority. Perhaps they were trying too hard to ape a real-life paper-and-pen task list, where you can only add things to the bottom of a list and not move them around. Perhaps they just ran out of time. Whatever the reason, not being able to organise lists in any way made them very difficult to use for anything much beyond _get milk, get bread_.

Happily, this shortfall has been rectified in iOS 6. As in many other iOS list views, tapping &#8220;Edit&#8221; takes you into a mode that allows you to manually move tasks up and down or quickly delete items. Any changes you make in the list order are synced via iCloud to the Mac version. Likewise, changes made on the Mac soon appear on your phone. This works as I had expected, but it&#8217;s not quite what I&#8217;d hoped for. Having to first tap on &#8220;Edit&#8221; to enter the edit mode seems a little old-fashioned. I&#8217;d hoped they would implement something similar to the Calendar app, where you can tap and hold on an event to make it draggable. Even so, the ability to move tasks around makes Reminders enormously more useful.

In the date-based views, where you can see any tasks that have reminders set for that day, you _can&#8217;t_ sort manually. Your tasks are sorted according to the time of the reminder you&#8217;ve set. If you&#8217;re looking at the list for today&#8217;s date, any tasks from previous days that have not been completed will appear at the top of the list. This makes sense, and is a great improvement over the previous version, where the tasks were completely unordered.

**Display**
  
The thing I like least about iOS task managers is the way they display tasks, commonly using large, bold fonts and truncating the task description if it goes beyond one line. It looks messy and is hard to read. I don&#8217;t understand how this became so widespread &#8211; even the earliest Palm Pilots wrapped text to the next line. That Reminders gives you more room for your text is the thing that made me overlook its flaws and try it out in the first place. The text neatly wraps to the next line, then the next, then the next. The amount of space you have is not unlimited, though &#8211; it truncates after four lines &#8211; but partially because of the smaller font Apple uses, I&#8217;ve never had a problem with a task being too long. I was a little worried that this would change to accommodate manual sorting. It has not.

Displaying more than one line of text necessarily involves a trade off. The more lines you can see, the fewer tasks can fit on the screen. Almost every other app shows more tasks, an approach that seems to work for a lot of people. I much prefer being able to see the whole task.

One thing that has changed about the list display is notes. Previously, if you added a note to a task, you had to remember that you&#8217;d done it. There was no indication in the task list at all. Reminders in iOS 6 changes that in a way that I don’t mind, but may irk others: it actually displays the note (in small grey text) in the list view. Like the task description, you have up to four lines before the text truncates. If you are used to writing a lot in notes you may hate this.

The earlier version of Reminders gave you the option of assigning a priority to a task but did nothing with it. In iOS 6 it displays bright red exclamation marks in front of the task. I’m not a big fan of assigning priorities to tasks, but if you do, you might find this useful.

**Swiping**
  
Another thing I liked in iOS 5’s Reminders was the ability to swipe left or right to move to a different task list, similar to the way you move though screens in the springboard. At first I though it had been removed in the new version. Swiping over a task now makes the delete button appear (previously you had to go into the task details to delete something) and swiping in empty space does nothing. After a while, I worked out that you can still move between lists by swiping, but it has to be in the list title area.

**Adding Tasks**
  
With this release, Apple has made a nice change to the process of adding tasks using the keyboard. Previously, if you wanted to add a task with a reminder, you had to type the text, tap &#8220;Done&#8221;, then tap on the arrow to go the details screen, then add the reminder. Now, when you start typing the text, the arrow appears immediately, allowing you to move to the details screen without tapping &#8220;Done&#8221;. It’s a small, but welcome, improvement.

One disappointment with this new version is that it lacks the simple natural language processing found in the desktop version. On the Mac you can type _&#8220;Check out Geoff&#8217;s pics at 6 pm on Wed&#8221;_ and it&#8217;ll create a task _&#8220;Check out Geoff&#8217;s pics&#8221;_ with a reminder set for 6 PM on Wednesday. On iOS that doesn&#8217;t happen. You just get a task _&#8220;Check out Geoff&#8217;s pics at 6 pm on Wed&#8221;_ with no reminder. Something to look for in future updates, perhaps.

**A Close Match**
  
A year ago I thought Reminders was rather feeble. Now, with the introduction of the Mac version, iCloud syncing, and this latest update, it has become a very solid task management system. It matches my idea of how this kind of app should look, feel, and work, more closely than any others I&#8217;ve tried.
