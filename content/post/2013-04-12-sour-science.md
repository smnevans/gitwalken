Last week in science, my daughter&#8217;s class conducted an experiment. They had to measure how quickly a piece of chocolate melted in their mouths. They measured three situations: when the chocolate was simply held in the mouth, when it was held and agitated, and when it was chewed.

This week they did the same experiment but with sugar tablets. The teacher counted down, &#8220;Three, two, one, GO!&#8221; And they popped the tablets into their mouths.

My daughter can&#8217;t tell me whether the teacher burst out laughing before the first kid spat out the super sour lemon candy they had been tricked into eating or whether she held on for a few more seconds. She says, though, that she kept hers in until her face turned red and tears came to her eyes.

&#8220;Not crying tears, but tears like when you do a big yawn.&#8221;
