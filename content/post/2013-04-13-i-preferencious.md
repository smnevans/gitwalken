Last night I wasted five minutes shaking my head at [iA Writer’s][1] haughty &#8220;we know what is good for you&#8221; disdain for preferences. I then spent two hours hacking around with [FoldingText’s][2] mostly undocumented, completely unsupported theme system.

This is not a joke, but it may be funny.
