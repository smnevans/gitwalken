This is the innocuous opening to Scott Simpson&#8217;s innocuously titled blog post, &#8220;[A Few of My Favorite Recipes][1]&#8220;:

> **Omelette**
> 
>   1. Combine three large eggs, a little water, milk, and pepper together. 
>   2. Using a tiny fork, beat until the eggs are fluffy. 
>   3. Pour into a hot skillet, add a handful of cheese, fold in half. 
>   4. Serves one. 

The full post is the funniest thing I have ever read on the internet.

The first time I read it, about halfway though, I started to laugh. By the end I was laughing continuously &#8211; even the straight bits were funny.

It was the second time through that did me in. Knowing what was coming only made it funnier. By the time I got to the pizza there were _actual_ **literal** **_liquid_** tears streaming down my face as I read each word.

I&#8217;ve only had this kind of reaction when reading or watching something a handful of times. For reference:

  1. **Withnail and I**: when Withnail drinks lighter fluid and is warned by Marwood to never mix his drinks.
  2. **Molloy**: when Moran sends his son off to buy a bicycle.
  3. **Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow**: when Slothrop tries some English candy.
  4. **Derek and Clive**: pretty much all of it.

I&#8217;ve laughed at a lot of stuff both on and off the internet since March, 2010, when this was posted, but never as hard.

Thanks Scott.
