The kids were away last weekend so I got to catch up with a lot of videos, articles, and interviews that had been on my to-read/see list for a while. Two standouts were interviews with Jeffrey Zeldman and Ross Floate.

Jeffery&#8217;s interview in [The Great Discontent][1] covers tons of ground. He describes how he moved from music to advertising and then to the web, and goes on to talk about his companies [Happy Cog][2], [A List Apart][3], and [A Book Apart][4]. I&#8217;ve been reading his blog since the days of _[Charlotte Gray][5]_ but there was a _lot_ here that was new to me. That he manages to do all this _and_ exercise _and_ spend time with his daughter is amazing and rather humbling.

In Ross&#8217; [video interview][6] with [Jeremy Fuksa][7], he talks about how he found his way from editing the uni newspaper to running his own firm, [Floate Design Partners][8], and how he sees the job of a designer (&#8220;to solve complex problems&#8221;) as separate from the business of making things look pretty. Also, he&#8217;s not a big fan of aimlessly searching for &#8220;inspiration&#8221;:

> _The idea of trying to find inspiration…_
     
> _I think it&#8217;s a crutch and…_
     
> _I think it&#8217;s wank._

Not one to mince words.
