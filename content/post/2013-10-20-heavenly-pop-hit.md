My daughter told me tonight there was a song she&#8217;d heard in a movie last week that she liked and wanted to hear again. She said she thought it might be famous because she had heard it before &#8211; maybe &#8211; but she didn&#8217;t know the name or the singer.

&#8220;Is it in English or Japanese?&#8221;  
_English_.  
Good. That meant there was at least _some_ chance that I might know it.

&#8220;Was it sung by boys or girls?&#8221;  
_I&#8217;m not sure. Maybe boys.  
_ Hmmm.

I asked her how it sounded and she la-la-la&#8217;d the chorus of a well-known 60s pop songÂ so perfectly that I thought she might have been just pretending not to know it. I could tell from her face, though, that she was on the level. I opened up my computer and within seconds had The Beach Boys&#8217; _Wouldn&#8217;t It Be Nice_ pumping from the speakers.

Her mouth dropped open and her eyes went wide.

_How &#8211; how did you know that?_

And for two minutes I was the best father that had ever lived.
