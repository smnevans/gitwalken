Neven Mrgan has a new game on the way called Greyout. Sam Barlow, the creator of Her Story, [played a beta version][1] and had this to say:

> Liked Blackbar? This is harder but also cleverer. Lots more feels too. Prepare your brain 

I loved [Blackbar][2]. There were a few screens that stumped me for a while and one that had me scratching my head for a couple of days _both_ times I played it, but a lot of it was fairly easy to work out. That worked for the game, though, because it kept the story moving along. I can&#8217;t wait to see how Neven balances the challenge and narrative in this one.

Check out [Neven's blog][3] to see the teaser trailer he&#8217;s put together. Looks like it&#8217;ll be a really relaxing, laid-back experience.
