Earlier this month I broke the screen on my out-of-warranty Kindle. I contacted Amazon and was able to get a replacement at a reduced price. It was a fairly simple process but a lot of it was new to me. I thought I’d document it here to give people in the same boat an idea of what they should expect. 

[<img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-297" title="Broken Kindle" src="http://sidewalken.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_1901-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="584" />][1]

When I pulled my Kindle from my bag and found Virginia Woolf’s frozen in place on the top half of the screen, I was not terribly surprised. I haven’t really taken such great care of it, often letting it slide down to the bottom of my backpack or squeezing it between two laptops.

I went to the Amazon’s troubleshooting site and followed the reset instructions there. I could see the reset happening on the functional bottom half of the screen but the top remained frozen. I’d heard that Amazon had a generous attitude towards replacements so I sent their support department an email.

A few hours later I got a reply explaining that for this kind of problem I’d have to either call or start a live chat with a support representative.

I signed in to my Amazon account and started a live chat. As I’d expected, the first rep had me go through the reset process again and asked when I had last charged it. When the reset failed to fix the problem, she bumped me up to a higher level. 

After checking my purchase date and seeing that my Kindle was out of warranty, the new rep explained my options. If it were still under warranty, she said, they would have sent out a free replacement. They couldn’t do that, but she offered to send me a replacement for $65.00 plus $11.98 for shipping to Japan. I asked her to go ahead and do that and soon received an email asking me to send the broken Kindle back to Amazon which included a link to a UPS shipping label I could print out.

The return instructions asked me to affix the label to the box, print out some invoices, and take it to a UPS drop off location. There are some UPS stores in Japan, but they are few and far between. There are only three in the Osaka area and the time and expense of getting to one would almost cancel out the discount I had got. I called one of the centres in Osaka and asked if they could come out and pick it up. They checked the tracking number and said that they could. They also asked me to leave the box open so the driver could confirm the contents.

When the driver turned up the next day, it was obvious that this was the first time he’d dealt with this kind of return. He checked the contents of the box and asked me to explain what it was; he&#8217;d never seen anything like it before. He was a bit confused when I asked for some kind of proof that I had handed over the Kindle but he went to a nearby convenience store, copied the invoice, signed it, and gave it to me as a kind of receipt.

Three days later I got an email from Amazon saying that they had received my old Kindle, bringing the story to an end. Overall, I was happy with how fast and easy the process was. Either Amazon or UPS could change their policies at any time so I can’t guarantee that you’ll have the same experience.

I thought it was interesting that nobody asked me how the screen had broken. I knew I had been less than careful handling it, so I felt that it was probably my own fault. If, however, I’d kept it in a case and handled it carefully the whole time, I don’t think I’d have been quite as happy with the offer of a paid replacement. If you&#8217;ve handled your Kindle with more care, I have a feeling that if you really try to make a persuasive case you might be able to get it replaced for less or even for free.

Anyway, time to give Amazon some more money. [But where to start?][2]
