One of my favourite episodes of my favourite podcast &#8211; [Roberto Baldwin singing LCD Soundsystem&#8217;s &#8220;All My Friends&#8221; on It Might Get Personal][1].



When I first watched this I was blown away. I had somehow not heard any LCD Soundsystem songs up till then. I assumed, based solely on their name, that they were a Daft Punk-ish group that I wouldn&#8217;t be terribly interested in &#8211; a mistake I&#8217;d made before, have made since (Japandroids), and will almost certainly make again.
