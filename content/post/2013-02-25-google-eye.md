A lot of the pieces I&#8217;ve read about Google Glasses have focused on how it feels to wear and use them. What I&#8217;m more interested in is what it feels like talking to someone who is wearing them, someone who at any moment in your conversation may be reading tweets or SMS messages or some other malarkey while they are pretending to talk to you.

The good thing mobile phones is that when someone is looking at one, you can be fairly sure that they aren&#8217;t paying attention to you. What happens with Google Glasses? Surely there&#8217;s some kind of telltale sign that what&#8217;s happening on that little bit of glass has got more of their attention than you do.

As much as I dislike the image of a group of people, heads down, tapping away at their phones, I think I prefer it to that of people standing, heads held high, staring off into space, occasionally muttering to themselves.
