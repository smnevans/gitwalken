After a few hours of shopping we stopped at a café for a break, finding a table next to a young couple &#8211; I’m guessing university age.

The girl got up to go to the bathroom leaving her iPhone on the table and her bag hooked on the back of her chair. No big deal. Her boyfriend &#8211; unusually tall and muscular &#8211; was there to watch over them. After about twenty seconds he also stood up and headed to the bathroom, leaving the girl’s stuff and his own bag completely unattended.

There&#8217;s something about this complete obliviousness to the risk of theft that I find both awesome and terrifying.
