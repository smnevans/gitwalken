I helped my dad out with some pruning yesterday. Then we moved some reticulation pipes around, fixed some broken sprinkler heads, went to the garden centre and bought flowers, mulch, and fertiliser, came home, spread the mulch, planted the flowers, and finally fertilised and watered the lawn.

I&#8217;d expected to be outside for ten or fifteen minutes and it was a relatively cool, overcast day so I didn&#8217;t think to put sunscreen on. As the minutes turned to hours I continued not to think about putting sunscreen on, the clouds and the breeze blinding me to the UV rays pouring down upon me.

So, I&#8217;m now the wincing, embarrassed owner of lobster-like neck and Hellboy inspired arms.

Not my finest hour.
