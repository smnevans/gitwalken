[Birdhouse][1] is a lightsaber, an elegant weapon for a more civilised age. When it was released by [Cameron Hunt][2] and [Adam Lisagor][3] in early 2009, Twitter was still fresh, un-monetized, and mostly unsullied by brands hoping to “engage” their customers. When people mentioned celebrities using Twitter, they were probably talking about Stephen Fry.

In some ways it shows its age. It doesn’t have username auto-completion, it can’t automatically shorten links, and you can’t use it to post pictures. However, for capturing and polishing witty, poignant ideas it is still the best tool out there.

Perhaps my favourite aspect of the program is the publishing system, a system I wish were copied by every app that sends text from a little window out into the cold, hard world.

What Cameron and Adam understood, I think, was that even smart people make mistakes, especially when they’re typing with their thumbs on a tiny piece of glass, and that kind app makers should do what they can to help them avoid looking dumb.

Here’s how you post things in most apps:

  1. Write something.
  2. Tap “Send”.

Here’s Birdhouse’s approach:

  1. Write your thing.
  2. Tape “Done”. The keyboard slides away letting you see the whole tweet.
  3. Tap “Publish”. A subtle “Publish?” prompt appears in the bottom task bar.
  4. Tap “Publish” again. And you’re done.

This may sound cumbersome, but in practice it isn’t. The nice thing about that “Publish?” prompt is that it doesn’t appear as a big modal dialog in the middle of the screen. If you want to go ahead and publish, you don’t have to move your thumb. Just press the same button again.

I also like what happens _after_ you send your tweet. The tweet is still displayed but the “Publish” has been replaced by an “Unpublish” button so, if you see a mistake or realise too late that what you’ve written sounds meaner or dumber than you thought, you can easily and quickly delete it.

Imagine how much better the world would be if every email, Twitter client, or social app encouraged people to take a second look at what they were about to send before they sent it. A lot better. That&#8217;s how much better it would be.
