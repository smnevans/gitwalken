I tried making Serious Eat's fried chicken last night. It was okay. Just okay. My wife and kids were impressed but it fell short of where I wanted it to be. The skin was crispy but quiet bland. Next time I'll pump up the spices. The chicken flavourful and tender but a bit too tender. Next time I'll start the marinade in the morning rather than the night before.

- Make sure to let the buttermilk drip away before dropping it in the flour.
- Much more flavour needed in the flour - more garlic, onion, paprika.
- Make sure to get rid of excess flour
- A bit less time in the
