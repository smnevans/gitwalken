[No Recipes&#8217; Pan-fried chicken teriyaki][1] is so easy even I can consistently pull it off. If only Japanese style chicken thighs were available somewhere in Perth. As it is I have to buy thigh cutlets and hamfistedly remove the bone myself. It&#8217;s easily the most difficult part of the whole meal.
