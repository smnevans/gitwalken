Woke at four this morning to drive my wife into Namba so she could catch a train to the airport. Got home as dawn was beginning to break. The air above the rice field across from my house was full of bats, whirling and swooping in search of moths and mosquitos.

In ten years we&#8217;ve had only two bats in the house.

The first I caught, after an hour long chase, in an old <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415919436_607e532a31.jpg?v=0" title="The t-shirt in question. "We are having a heavenly time."">Fables of the Reconstruction</a> t-shirt, so small and fragile it looked I was afraid I&#8217;d crush it.

The second we discovered in the early hours of a summer morning, madly circling our bedroom, almost silent but giving off enough of a flutter to let us know it was there. Opened all the windows and it found its way out.

I&#8217;m going to miss them.
