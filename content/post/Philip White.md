“The wines are... all visceral and sensual justifications of their presumptions... Blue Poles vineyard is not going away. Prepare to be dazzled.”

“Great tasting & visit yesterday at Blue Poles! Exciting Merlot (yes, Merlot!) & Merlot/CF blends from southern Margaret River. Wines to watch!”

“2011 Shiraz. It’s a steal at the price. It has the fruit, it has the spice, it has the poise... One of the best Blue Poles wines I’ve tasted..”

“2010 Allouran: It actually popped out of a blind line-up for its succulence and general drinkability... It’s a great release and I suspect will cellar a spell too.”
 
Gary Walsh – 30/4/2015:
“2011 Allouran. ...a fair riot of richness and perfume here... Acidity is spot on, and drives a path through the succulent fruit... Right proper wine.”

“2010 Res. Merlot. This demonstrates just how alluring and seductive great Merlot can be...  Beautiful attention to detail in the vineyard is proudly on display here.
