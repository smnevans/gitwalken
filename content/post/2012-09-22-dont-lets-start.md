On the latest episode of [It Might Get Personal][1], [Keri Maijala][2] sings a beautiful version of one of my favourite songs, They Might Be Giants&#8217; &#8220;[Don&#8217;t Let&#8217;s Start][3]&#8220;. It&#8217;s slower than the original, a change that accentuates both the sadness and silliness of the lyrics. Talking to David McCreath afterwards, she describes her terror of performing on the show:

> _This is something completely different. When I do karaoke I tend to imitate the person I&#8217;m singing, and that becomes it&#8217;s own little thing and it&#8217;s funny … but I&#8217;m not going to do John Linnell better than John Linnell does him, so why do that?_
> 
> _So now this is just pure me, in a song that means something really, really personal to me, and I&#8217;m just going to go ahead and put that out there for everybody that&#8217;s watching._

This is exactly what I most like about this show. People singing songs that really mean something personal to them, going ahead and putting that out there.
