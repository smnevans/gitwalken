One of the developers of [Forecast][1] wrote up some of the [lessons they learned][2] from making their app. It&#8217;s pretty good, the last hint especially:

> Tap things twice. Swipe at things that shouldn’t be swiped.
       
> Touch things that shouldn’t be touched. Mush it and squeeze
       
> it and scrape it. Do it when you’re lying in bed, in the
       
> bathroom, walking down the street. Over, and over, and over again.

So many apps, both native and web, seem designed to be used in _just_ the right way and woe be to any sloppy tappers or inadvertent swipers.

One of the most infuriating examples of this for me is [TweetBot][3], an otherwise excellent app.

This is the behaviour that drives me crazy: when you tap on a link in a tweet it opens in the built-in browser; when you tap and hold on a link it pops up a menu from which you can choose to, among other things, open the link in Safari or send it to Pinboard. This would by great if my idea of a tap wasn&#8217;t TweetBot&#8217;s idea of a tap and hold. I am forever tapping links expecting them to open but getting the menu instead.

So app developers, please mush, squeeze, scrape your apps &#8211; and make sure a tap and hold requires actual holding.
