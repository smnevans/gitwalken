Year Walk is a great little mystery game. It’s not hard, but there were a couple of times that I wanted someone to whisper a hint in my ear to help me move forward. Venturing onto the web I found only step-by-step illustrated walkthroughs made, I suppose, for people who hate to play games.

Here are some proper hints &#8211; first some general ones.

_Make a map:_ the Year Walk game world is small. You think you can hold it in your head but you just can&#8217;t, Nemo.

_Get your hands dirty:_ if it looks like it matters, it matters. Touch it, drag it, spin it, slide it, twist &#8211; unlock it. Technologic. Technologic.

And remember: _one hand good, two hands better._

_No Companion:_ if you don&#8217;t like mystery, why are you playing a mystery game? Save it till you&#8217;ve played though once. You&#8217;ll need it to open that darned box, too.

That&#8217;s really all you need to know. Here are some extra pointers for bits that had me scratching my head.

_Box:_ the secret hides in the companion app. Leave it till later.

_Owls:_ Make them sing. What? You don’t know the song? Maybe someone is hanging around who can give you some pointers.

_Forest:_ Use your ears. Even if you’re tone deaf you can tell the difference between a high-five and a bad-luck-try-again.

_Infants:_ Not even the Buddha can carry a baby with one finger.

And in case of broken gravity, do a cartwheel.

_Church:_ You’ve seen the answer. You just need to put your fingers on it.
