I just put the girls to bed, bubbling with excitment and nerves. For the first time in ages they wanted to share a bed. Tomorrow is their first day of school in Australia, their first day of school in English. They both _know_ some English but neither of them speak it with any confidence, especially with people other than me.

We&#8217;ve been here for a while now. but tomorrow is when they really start to be in Australia rather than not being in Japan.

Have fun kids.
