My cat left Japan with a high-pitched pleading meow. Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, or during her month in quarrantine, it mutated into a demanding, matronly squawk. _Very_ hard on the ears.

Another change: A couple of finger snaps used to be all it took to quiet her. Now she doesnâ€™t stop till she gets what she wants.

What&#8217;s next? Is she going to start complaining about every piece of food we put in front of her? Is she going to talk non-stop about getting her ears pierced? Only time will tell.
