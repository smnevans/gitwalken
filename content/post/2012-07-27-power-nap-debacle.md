How&#8217;s that for a hyperbolic headline? Not bad for a first try, huh?

[Power Nap][1] is a new feature in Mountain Lion that lets your laptop do some tasks &#8211; downloading email, updating iCloud, and the like &#8211; while it&#8217;s asleep. This time yesterday I didn&#8217;t even know that it existed, but I do now and I&#8217;m as **mad as hell** about it. Well, not really mad, just a little disappointed, and a bit puzzled.

Power Nap, you see, only works on MacBooks that have a built in SSD drive, newer Airs and the Retina MacBook. Neat, I thought, I&#8217;ve got one of those, a MacBook Air bought in early 2011, which Apple calls a &#8220;Late 2010&#8221; model. I checked my Energy Saver preferences and didn&#8217;t see anything about Power Nap. I checked the ML specs at [Apple&#8217;s site][2] and saw that Power Nap was listed as being supported only on MBAs from Mid 2011. Too bad.

The thing is, it seems that it may, until very recently, have said it would work on MBAs from Late 2010 and on. So, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m disappointed. One of the handful of Mountain Lion features that could really make a difference for me right now won&#8217;t work on my computer. I didn&#8217;t even know about it until yesterday so I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m crushed. I haven&#8217;t been looking forward to it for months.

But I&#8217;m puzzled, too, because across the Atlantic (I checked a map) on [Apple&#8217;s UK][3] site it still lists (at just after four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon on Friday in Japan) Power Nap as being supported on my Late 2010 MacBook Air, which has me a little hopeful that someday a firmware update will roll out that enables it.

So, disappointed, puzzled, and a little hopeful.

Pssst. If you are in the same boat and have nerves of steel you could try [this hack][4] from the MacRumors Forum to get it to run. The comments there don&#8217;t give me much hope though.
