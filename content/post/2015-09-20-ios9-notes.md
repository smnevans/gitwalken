Apple released iOS9 this week. Some notes:

The blue dots that mark newly updated apps are, sadly, still there. Who finds this useful? If they must appear could they not disappear after a day or two rather than requiring that I open the app.

The Reminders app is still pretty much the same. I&#8217;d hoped for two things:

  * black as a list colour choice
  * the ability to tap and hold on a task to make it moveable the way you can in Clear and Apple&#8217;s own Calendar app.

Neither made it into this release. Apple must at least be considering the second one though, right? Right?

The News app didn&#8217;t show up at all. I needed to change my region setting to USA to be able to see it. This will apparently change in 9.1.

Ad blocking seems to be a very big deal, judging from my Twitter feed at least. I haven&#8217;t given much thought to this either way but I&#8217;m pretty disappointed that my joke tweet about it garnered not even one measly star:

> &#8220;Why’s everyone so excited about ab blocking these days? I’ve been doing it for years with beer and cheeseburgers. You will see no abs on me.&#8221;
