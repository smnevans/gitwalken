[Vine&#8217;s][1] &#8220;Activity&#8221; screen displays, in addition to follows, likes, and comments, any comment that is made on a video you&#8217;ve liked.

I don&#8217;t think this is a very good idea. While I _might_ be interested in comments made by those I follow, it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;d want to see comments made by people I don&#8217;t know. Take a look at the comments on photos by some of the more popular Instagrammers to see what I mean. Some get _a lot_ of comments, many of which are variations on &#8220;So cute&#8221;, &#8220;Love the colours&#8221;, or &#8220;Looks delicious&#8221;. Comments like this are fine for a service like Instagram or Vine, but they&#8217;re directed at the photogrpher and not out at the larger community.

The Vine community is still small, so right now this behavior is more odd than annoying. Unchanged, though, I can see it making the Activity screen a tiresome place to visit.
