In two years of using my iPhone I&#8217;ve accidentally activated Siri by pressing the home button a bit longer than intended maybe half a dozen times. Since updating to iOS9 it&#8217;s happening half a dozen times a day. I don&#8217;t understand why Apple have changed what counts as a long press. I&#8217;ve seen lots of complaints about Siri but none that it&#8217;s too hard to activate.
