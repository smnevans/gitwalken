Amazon&#8217;s new Paperwhite Kindle looks interesting. It addresses the only real annoyance I have with my current one, not being able to read in low light conditions. I&#8217;m a bit concerned that it doesn&#8217;t have any buttons, though. As a lunchtime reader, I really like being able to turn pages without having to touch the screen &#8211; no greasy finger marks.

I&#8217;m now regretting just a little my decision to buy a discounted replacement for my Kindle when the screen went south couple of months ago. The idea that they might release new models never occurred to me. It feels like they just released the Fire and the Touch a few months ago.
