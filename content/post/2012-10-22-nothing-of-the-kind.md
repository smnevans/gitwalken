I was wondering when David McCreath, the host of It Might Get Personal, would have a go himself. Well, on the podcasts tenth episode he did, singing [Jimmie Dale Gilmore&#8217;s &#8220;Nothing of the Kind&#8221;][1]. The song is great, I wish all country music were more like this, and David&#8217;s singing voice is suprisingly rich.
