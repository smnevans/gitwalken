Yesterday I drove 60 kilometres south to help by brother-in-law lay the concrete foundation for a wall he’s building in the back yard. My “help” consisted mainly of levelling of the concrete, scraping stubborn bits of concrete from the bottom of the wheelbarrow, and clumsily collapsing the carefully shaped sides of the trench he and my sister spent most of the previous day digging. In spite of my incompetence I was rewarded with a thanks and a homemade hamburger.

The nicest part of the day, though, was the drive. It’s about an hour each way &#8211; perfect for listening to some Pavement. I got through most of Wowee Zowee on the way there and listened to Terror Twilight on the way back, haphazardly singing along as best I could. Both of these records were released while I was in Japan, so it was the first time I had listened to them properly cranked up as I flew along the freeway at 100 kph. I never knew what I was missing.
