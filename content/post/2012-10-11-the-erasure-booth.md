I walk into the cinema, pick up my ticket, buy some popcorn, and wander over to a small booth next to the gift shop.

&#8220;Can I get an erasure, thanks?&#8221; I say to the guy at the counter.

&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he says, looking up from his iPad, &#8220;do you want a full or a partial?&#8221;

I&#8217;m here to see a film I&#8217;ve been looking forward to for years. I&#8217;ve read the book, seen all the trailers, and read interviews with the director and cast. I&#8217;ve seen dozens of 140 character reviews from my friends on Twitter.

&#8220;Better make it a full.&#8221; I tell the kid.

He looks relieved. Partials, with their endless options, are a lot more work. Last month I got stuck behind a guy who spent five minutes working out if he wanted to erase all knowledge of Tim Burton, all knowledge of Johnny Depp, or just the memory of the films they&#8217;ve made together. A _lot_ more work.

He swipes and taps his iPad a few times then lifts something that looks like an iPhone to my eyes.

The light is blinding.

Some people say that they can _feel_ the nanobots at work, zooming along their synapses and stunning very specific parts of the brain into temporary amnesia. I tend to think they&#8217;re full of it. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve ever felt anything.

Five seconds later and I&#8217;ve got my eyes back.

&#8220;Everything alright sir?&#8221;

It takes me a moment to recall where I am and what I&#8217;ve just had done.

&#8220;Yeah, fine. Thanks.&#8221;

&#8220;Enjoy the movie.&#8221; he says, his eyes moving to the next person in line.

Stepping away I look down at the ticket in my hand.
