I wandered into Google&#8217;s Movie & TV Store hoping but not at all expecting to find [_True Detective_][1]. I figured it was a long shot &#8211; it&#8217;s not on iTunes and won&#8217;t be out on DVD till June &#8211; but there it was, looking somewhat out of place next to _The Big Bang Theory_ and _The Vampire Diaries_.

I&#8217;ve learned to be wary, though, so even as I clicked through to buy the first episode I thought it was likely that they&#8217;d throw up the all too familiar geographical restrictions error. One minute later, however, and I was watching the actual thing &#8211; listening to the actual words.

They only play in SD on a computer and you have to stream them, but I&#8217;m happy just to be able to watch them at all. Not perfect, but it&#8217;ll do for now.
