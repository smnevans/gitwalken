> I&#8217;m not saying we can&#8217;t have the fun next-generation Internet, where everyone wears stupid goggles and has profound conversations with their refrigerator. I&#8217;m just saying we can&#8217;t slap it together like we&#8217;ve been doing so far and expect everything to work itself out.

> The good news is, it&#8217;s a design problem! You&#8217;re all designers here &#8211; we can make it fun! We can build an Internet that&#8217;s distributed, resilient, irritating to governments everywhere, and free in the best sense of the word, like we dreamed of in the 90&#8217;s. But it will take effort and determination. It will mean scrapping permanent mass surveillance as a business model, which is going to hurt. It will mean pushing laws through a sclerotic legal system. There will have to be some nagging.

This is a sliver of [Maciej Cegłowski&#8217;s talk from this year&#8217;s Webstock][1] &#8211; partly an examination of the life and career of Lev Termen (inventor of, among other things, the Theremin) and partly a rant [<sup>1</sup>][2]{#return-note-966-1.simple-footnote} against the advertising driven &#8220;centralized version of the Internet based on permanent surveillance&#8221;.

It&#8217;s best to imagine Cegłowski on a stage saying these words while reading. He has a refreshingly human giving-a-talk speaking style that is very different from how most people talk when they&#8217;re in front of a bunch of people. Watch [Thoreau 2.0][3], his contribution to XOXO, to get an idea of what I mean.
