I usually get off the bus using the doors at the back. Yesterday, however, because the bus was almost empty by the time it got to my stop, I used the door at the front. As I tagged off with my SmartRider card I said, &#8220;Thanks, have a good night&#8221; to the driver. I swear it sounded like he said &#8220;Thanks, Simon. You too&#8221; in reply.

There&#8217;s a good chance I misheard him but it made me wonder if when you swipe your card it displays your name for the driver to see &#8211; some misguided measure to clamp down on fraud, perhaps. Maybe it shows your date of birth, too. I&#8217;ll try it Monday after next and see if I get a &#8220;Thanks, Simon. And happy birthday.&#8221;
