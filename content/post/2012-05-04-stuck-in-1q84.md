My latest crack at finishing _1Q84_ is not going well. I&#8217;m about two thirds through and about ready to set it aside, again.

I&#8217;m not really sure why. I&#8217;m a Haruki Murakami fan. I&#8217;ve read all of his novels and most of his non-fiction. Most of them I finished in a day or two. None of them took more than a week. I feel like I&#8217;ve been reading this one for years.

So why don&#8217;t I like this book? It&#8217;s a little repetitive and has some very unpleasant scenes but neither of those things stopped me from finishing, and enjoying, _Infinite Jest_. I actually quite like the main characters, Aomame and Tengo, too. I want things to go well for them and to see where they end up but I just don&#8217;t know if I have the energy for the ride.

I&#8217;ll give it another day or two. Maybe if it had more sword fights or someone fired an arrow now and thenâ€¦
