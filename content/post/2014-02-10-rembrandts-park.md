One side of the park has this sign:

The other side has this:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%" src="http://sidewalken.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_0589.jpg" alt="IMG 0589" title="IMG_0589.JPG" border="0" />

Which used to look like this:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:100%" src="http://sidewalken.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_0636.jpg" alt="IMG 0636" title="IMG_0636.jpg" border="0" />

Who says a park can&#8217;t have two names? Just because its parents named it _Remembrance Park_ does that mean it can&#8217;t choose to call itself _Rembrance Park_ if it likes?

We let countries and cities get away with it all the time. And people! With our short forms, nicknames, and twitter handles, we can&#8217;t talk.

So while this _might_ be a sign that the city council needs to pay just a little more attention to detail, I prefer to look at it as a sign of a young park growing up and gingerly feeling about for its own identity. Let&#8217;s cut it some slack. Okay?
