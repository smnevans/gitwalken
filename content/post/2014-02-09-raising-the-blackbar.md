For technical reasons too boring to go into I wasn&#8217;t able to play Neven Mrgan&#8217;s [Blackbar][1] when it first came out. This week I finally got my chance. I&#8217;d expected to enjoy it but I was surprised at just how good it turned out to be.

There were a couple of screens that took me a good couple of hours to work out, mostly because I was overthinking them. I would recommend against peeking at any hints you might find online. You&#8217;ll just end up feeling like an ◼︎◼︎◼︎◼︎◼︎ when you see the answer.

It&#8217;s not easy peasy, but it&#8217;s not that hard. If I can work it out I&#8217;m sure you can too.
