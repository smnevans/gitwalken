A short while ago, scientists at CERN used the font  [A short while ago, scientists at CERN used the font][1] on a slide in their presentation announcing that they had discovered the Higgs Boson. Web nerds around the world &#8211; including, for the shortest instant, myself &#8211; rolled their eyes.

The next day [I watched a video][2] in which a bunch of “hipsters” were unable to make even an approximate guess at what the Higgs was. Was it an band? An artist, perhaps? A kind of cheese, maybe? For the second time in two days I found myself shaking my head in dismay. _How could they have no idea what it was?_

I began to wonder how I had come to know these things, that Comic Sans is a font that draws derision, and that the Higgs Boson is a particle that gives all matter its mass?

I can clearly remember where I learned about the Higgs. A few years ago, riding the subway to work, I listened to an episode about it on Melvyn Bragg’s excellent podcast (and radio show), [In Our Time][3]. If I had never listened to that particular episode or hadn’t been paying attention, I may well have been one of those people scratching their heads.

I can’t pin down the exact moment that I became aware that of Comic Sans was a font to avoid, but I’m pretty sure it was due primarily to reading John Gruber’s blog, [Daring Fireball][4], over the years. If I had never read DF, perhaps I would be happily typing up notices and announcements using our fun comical friend even today. Who knows?

I was just lucky. Someone was giving out this knowledge and my brain was in a receptive mood.

The next time I hear someone pronounce the ’s’ in Camus, or say they&#8217;ve never even heard of a band called The Suburbs, or that they are looking forward to eating _real_ French Toast when they visit Paris, I&#8217;ll think twice before making fun of them on Twitter or elsewhere.

Here, for your amusement, are a couple of the more notable ignorances from my past:

  * **David Foster Wallace** 
  
    The first I heard of him was on the day he committed suicide. A giant on the contemporary literary scene and I had no idea who he was.
  * **Drinks have calories?**
  
    Kind of an embarrassing one, but it took me years to really accept that drinks (coke, beer and the like) contained calories. No matter how many times I heard it, it just didn&#8217;t sink in.
  * **A not so dominant Apple** 
  
    I bought my first Mac in 1997, when Apple was on the verge of collapse. At the time, though, I thought I was buying into the dominant computing ecosystem. All my friends in Japan had Macs, as did the handful of friends with computers I’d known in Australia, so I thought it was _Microsoft_ that was the plucky underdog.

And that&#8217;s just a start.
