_Dad, look what I found at school!_

She reaches into her bag and pulls out a pile of old screws and rusty nails.

_My school must be really old._

&#8220;You can&#8217;t play with things like this. It&#8217;s dangerous&#8221;.

She fixes me with a stare.

_I&#8217;m not **playing**. I&#8217;m **collecting**._
