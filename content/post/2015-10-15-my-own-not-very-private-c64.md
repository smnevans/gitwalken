My first computer was a Commodore 64. Way before I had my own though, I had access to one at the local public computer lab, aka K-Mart. The nearby library had a few C64 magazines, all of which had plenty of BASIC programs ready to be typed out. Magazines, for some reason, could not be loaned out. I can’t clearly remember but I think there was also a rule against them being photocopied. Otherwise why would I, as I clearly remember, have spent hours copying these programs by hand into an exercise book?

After I’d got one down and more or less checked I’d ride my embarrassingly non-BMX bike to K-Mart where I would stand for hours typing away at the display machine. It seems strange now but I don’t ever remember anyone ever asking me to move on or stop what I was doing. The majority of the programs I tried out threw up a SYNTAX ERROR, caused either by my hunt-and-bash typing, poor copying, or the frequent flaws in the magazine text.

Sometimes, though, they would work. When they did it was like hitting a home run. I had no way to save these programs, though, so when I was done I had no choice but to just walk away, leaving them to be wiped when the power was shut off for the night.
