Over the last year I’ve thought a lot about how to use Twitter without letting it take up too much space in my life. I’ve swung from spells of abstinence to periods of intense engagement. I’ve unfollowed, re-followed, and played with a combination of lists, time constraints, mute and keyword filters.

What I’ve come up with is a two-tier approach that, for the past few months, has worked well for me. I have a small list &#8211; about twenty people &#8211; that I check a few times a day. This is the marrow of my Twitter experience. In addition to the people in this core group, I follow about two hundred others. I read pretty much everything that appears in my core list (it’s probably only a couple of dozen tweets a day) and dip into my main timeline every now and then to see what is going on in the larger, noisier Twitter neighbourhood. It was easy to set up using TweetBot, you can set any list as your default main view, but by bookmarking the list and making that _the_ place I go to check Twitter, it works in my browser, too.

This for me is much more manageable &#8211; and fun &#8211; than the way I used to use Twitter, trying to read everything by everyone I followed and following up each and every shiny thing that caught my eye. Of course I “[miss][1]” a lot &#8211; interesting links, funny anecdotes, glorious puns, and the like &#8211; but there is still plenty to see.

This, of course, is not _the_ solution to being overwhelmed by Twitter, it&#8217;s just mine. If you’re interested in this topic, I recommend reading Andre Torrez’s [recent blog posts][2] about his search for his own solution.
