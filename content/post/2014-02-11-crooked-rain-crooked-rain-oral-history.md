> Well, we&#8217;re big Richard Linklater fans, so when &#8220;Slanted And Enchanted&#8221; was recorded, we were setting out to make like &#8220;Slacker Rock.&#8221; But now the thing is that this album is more influenced by his second film, &#8220;Dazed And Confused.&#8221; So we don&#8217;t really like being called &#8220;Slacker Rock&#8221; anymore because we feel like we&#8217;ve sorta kinda gone beyond our &#8220;Slacker&#8221; stage and gone into our &#8220;Dazed And Confused&#8221; stage.

This is Mark Ibold in an [interview with Mark Prindle][1] back in &#8217;94.

If you want to read more about the making of my second favourite Pavement record, check out this in-depth [oral history in Stereogum][2]. I especially liked the details of the actual recording process and the role played by mixing engineer Bryce Croggin in crafting the album&#8217;s sound.
