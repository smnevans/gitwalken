I watched Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8220;Hugo&#8221; last weekend with my daughters. I&#8217;d expected them to enjoy the fun, adventure-filled first half, but turn off when it switches gears and becomes a historical lecture.

They were distracted at first, squabbling over a broken pencil sharpener, but from the moment Hugo and Isabelle discovered Papa Georges&#8217; secret past, they sat transfixed, totally absorbed by the rise and fall of Georges Méliès.
