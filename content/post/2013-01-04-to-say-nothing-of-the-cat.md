This time last year I was shivering in my little house in Osaka, trying to make sense of many things I&#8217;d need to do in order to move my family (and cat) from Japan to Australia. Some, like registering my daughters as Australian citizens, seemed fairly straightforward. Others, getting a Partner Visa for my wife, for example, looked more formidable. One, negotiating Australia&#8217;s stringent animal import process, appeared to require the skills of a logistical ninja.

There was a fair bit of head scratching, more than a couple sleepless nights, and one or two Basil Fawtly-esque meltdowns, but somehow it all got done. In mid-November my wife, two daughters, and I touched down at Perth Airport.

For my family, 2012 was a year of saying goodbye. 2013 will be a year of saying hello.

So, umm, hello.
