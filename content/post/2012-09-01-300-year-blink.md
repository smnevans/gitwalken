In my weaker moments, I occasionally get the idea that starting a joke twitter account that just replies to gags as if they were meant to be taken seriously would be _hilarious_. I&#8217;ve managed so far to stop myself from setting one up, mainly because I realize it wouldn&#8217;t actually be that funny at all, but the idea still pops into my head from time to time. And now, well, it looks like I&#8217;ve waited too long. There are apparently tons of such joke accounts out there already, as this [post from Avery Edison][1] makes clear. Damn!
