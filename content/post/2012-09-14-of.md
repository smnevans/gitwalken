While I understand that people who misuse the word “literally” are widely considered to be amongst the worst people who have ever lived in the history of the world, I can’t honestly say it’s ever bothered me very much. It’s always clear what they mean. What, really, is the big deal?

If, however, you drop the “of” from “a couple of”, and say something like “I lived in China for a couple years.” I’ll initially react with concern because I’ll assume you’re having a stroke. If, after a minute or so, you exhibit no further stroke-like symptoms, I will loathe you (probably secretly) for as long as you draw breath, because you just stabbed my brain with your words.

Please don&#8217;t stab my brain.
