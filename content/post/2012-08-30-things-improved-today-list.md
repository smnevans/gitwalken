The headline feature in Cultured Code&#8217;s newly updated [Things 2][1] is obviously cloud syncing. What caught my eye, though, is an improvement they&#8217;ve made to the display of the Today list on the Mac.

Previously the tasks you had chosen to do today were displayed with the name of their associated project in smaller grey text in **front** of the task, so they were never aligned along the left. It looked messy and jagged. With Things 2 the project name is displayed after the task. It looks much, much better.

I&#8217;m a little disappointed, but not surprised, to see that they haven&#8217;t changed the other thing that bugged me about the Today list: that when you add a new item, it is added to the **top** of the list rather than the bottom. I&#8217;ve never understood the thinking behind this. When you make a list on paper, do you ever start from the bottom and add each thing to the top of the list? If you&#8217;re planning your day do you write down the _last_ thing you&#8217;re going to do then work your way back? The order of the items can be changed, but the whole thing seems unnecessarily cumbersome.

Perhaps there&#8217;s a secret preference that reverses this behaviour. If there is, I&#8217;d love to hear it.

Update &#8211; Aug 31: Cultured Code got in touch and said there was no secret preference. Hopes temporarily dashed, but if they told me, it wouldn&#8217;t be a secret, would it?
