Shaun Inman’s [The Last Rocket][1] is my favourite game. Sixty-four increasingly difficult levels requiring puzzle-solving skills, a thirst for experimentation, and (sometimes) lightening-quick reflexes. It is one of the few games I have finished, and the only one whose achievements I have _ever_ tried to complete (I still haven’t managed to finish the whole game without crashing once, though. Curse you 7-7!).

Compared to The Last Rocket’s full-course meal, [Flip’s Escape][2] is more of a tasty snack; a relatively simple game with the sole objective of getting as far as you can, trying to outrace a stellar shockwave while dodging the oncoming asteroids.

The controls are delightfully simple: you don’t control the direction or speed at which you travel, all you can do is stop. Working out when to stop at the right time and the right place and for how long is a little tricky at first, but you’ll pick it up in ten minutes or so. My advice is to read the instructions carefully and pay attention to your Star Meter.

[Flip’s Escape][3] is fun.
  
It looks and sounds great.
  
It only costs 99 cents (Just ¥85 in Japan).

Give it a go.
