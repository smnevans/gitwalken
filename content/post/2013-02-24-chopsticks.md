All the chopsticks in restaurants here are Chinese style: big, round and plastic. Accustomed as I am to the tapered, grippy chopsticks of Japan, it feels like eating with plastic broomsticks. Give me a humble pair of waribashi any day.

The only chopsticks I&#8217;ve found that are worse were the aluminium-tipped monstrosities I was given at an otherwise excellent ramen place in Northbridge. It was the eating-utensil equivalent of fingernails scratching a blackboard.
